abstract = {Energy and water availability were identified as the first order controls of evapotranspiration (ET) in ecohyrodrology. With a {\~{}}1,000 km precipitation gradient and distinct wet-dry climate, the North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT) was well suited for evaluating how energy and water availabilities constrain water use by vegetation, but has not been done yet. In this study, we addressed this question using Budyko framework that quantifies the evapotranspiration as a function of energy-limited rate and precipitation. Path analysis was adopted to evaluate the dependencies of water and carbon fluxes on ecohydrological variables. Results showed that the major drivers of water and carbon fluxes varied between wet and dry savannas: down-welling solar radiation was the primary driver of the wet season ET in mesic savanna ecosystems, while soil water availability was the primary driver in inland dryland ecosystems. Vegetation can significantly regulate water and carbon fluxes of savanna ecosystems, as supported by the strong link of LAI with ET and GPP from path analysis. Vegetation structure (i.e. the tree:grass ratio) at each site can regulate the impact of climatic constraint on ET and GPP. Sites with a low tree:grass ratio had ET and GPP that exceeded sites with high a tree:grass ratio when the grassy understory was active. Identifying the relative importance of these climate drivers and vegetation structure on seasonal patterns of water use by these ecosystems will help us decide our priorities when improving the estimates of ET and GPP.},

abstract = {Data on the distribution of root biomass are critical to understanding the ecophysiology of vegetation communities. This is particularly true when models are applied to describe ecohydrology and vegetation function. However, there is a paucity of such information across continental Australia. We quantified vertical and horizontal root biomass distribution in a woodland dominated by Angophora bakeri and Eucalyptus sclerophylla on the Cumberland Plains near Richmond, New South Wales. The site was characterised by a duplex (texture contrast) soil with the A horizon (to 70 cm) consisting of loamy sand and the B horizon (to {\textgreater} 10 m) consisting of sandy clay. The topsoil had a smaller bulk density, a smaller water holding capacity but a larger organic component and a larger hydraulic conductivity in comparison to the subsoil. Root biomass was sampled to 1.5 m depth and declined through the soil profile. Whilst total biomass in the B horizon was relatively small, its contribution to the function of the trees was highly significant. Coarse roots accounted for approximately 82{\%} of the root mass recovered. Lateral distribution of fine roots was generally even but coarse roots were more likely to occur closer to tree stems. Variation in tree diameter explained 75{\%} of the variation in total below-ground biomass. The trench method suggested the belowground biomass was 6.03 +/- 1.21 kg m(-2) but this method created bias towards sampling close to tree stems. We found that approximately 68{\%} of root material was within a 2 m radius of tree stems and this made up 54{\%} of the total number of samples but in reality, only approximately 5 to 10{\%} of the site is within a 2 m radius of tree stems. Based on these proportions, our recalculated belowground biomass was 2.93 +/- 0.59 kg m(-2). These measurements provide valuable data for modeling of ecosystem water use and productivity.},

abstract = {We compared the capacity of woody versus grassy vegetation covers to buffer high temperatures during heat waves by partitioning turbulent heat between latent ($\lambda$Ε) and sensible (H) fluxes, and quantifying advection using the Priestley-Taylor coefficient ($\alpha$), for a16-year old grassland and an adjoining 6-year old plantation. We found that because $\lambda$E dominated ({\textgreater}65{\%}) the turbulent flux in the plantation, and was at least twice as large as on the grassland ($\lambda$E {\textless}35{\%} of the turbulent flux) during heat waves, the ambient temperature over the plantation was up to 5 °C lower in the afternoon, and averaged 1.2 °C for the whole day, compared with the grassland. Both vegetation covers emitted significant amounts of H when soil-water availability was limited, and also in winter when canopy was mostly inactive because of dormancy in the grassland and mutual shading in the plantation due to low solar angle; during the winter, advection of additional energy from surrounding vegetation suppressed $\lambda$E and reduced $\alpha$ to {\textless}1.0 in both vegetation covers. Advection enhanced $\lambda$E during periods of frequent rainfalls in summer with mean $\alpha$ rising to 2.6 in the grassland and 3.4 in the plantation. Consistently low $\lambda$Ε but high H made the grassland a source rather than a sink for advective energy, while the plantation was the opposite. The broadleaved evergreen woody vegetation consistently maintained a larger $\lambda$Ε than the grassland in this mid-latitude environment, contrary to the smaller $\lambda$Ε observed over mostly coniferous forests at high (northern) latitudes ({\textgreater}35°). Annual evapotranspiration was 54{\%} lower from the grassland (384 mm) than from the plantation (834 mm). Woody vegetation covers dominated by broadleaved-species are therefore preferred for buffering extreme high temperatures during heat waves, and recommended for rehabilitating degraded landscapes in urban areas. We also present functions for approximating $\alpha$ for soil-water limited conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract. The savanna complex is a highly diverse global biome that occurs within the seasonally dry tropical to sub-tropical equatorial latitudes and are structurally and functionally distinct from grasslands and forests. Savannas are open-canopy environments that encompass a broad demographic continuum, often characterised by a changing dominance between C3-tree and C4-grass vegetation, where frequent environmental disturbances such as fire modulates the balance between ephemeral and perennial life forms. Climate change is projected to result in significant changes to the savanna floristic structure, with increases to woody biomass expected through CO2 fertilisation in mesic savannas and increased tree mortality expected through increased rainfall interannual variability in xeric savannas. The complex interaction between vegetation and climate that occurs in savannas has traditionally challenged terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), which aim to simulate the interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface to predict responses of vegetation to changing in environmental forcing. In this review, we examine whether TBMs are able to adequately represent savanna fluxes and what implications potential deficiencies may have for climate change projection scenarios that rely on these models. We start by highlighting the defining characteristic traits and behaviours of savannas, how these differ across continents and how this information is (or is not) represented in the structural framework of many TBMs. We highlight three dynamic processes that we believe directly affect the water use and productivity of the savanna system: phenology, root-water access and fire dynamics. Following this, we discuss how these processes are represented in many current-generation TBMs and whether they are suitable for simulating savanna fluxes. Finally, we give an overview of how eddy-covariance observations in combination with other data sources can be used in model benchmarking and intercomparison frameworks to diagnose the performance of TBMs in this environment and formulate road maps for future development. Our investigation reveals that many TBMs systematically misrepresent phenology, the effects of fire and root-water access (if they are considered at all) and that these should be critical areas for future development. Furthermore, such processes must not be static (i.e. prescribed behaviour) but be capable of responding to the changing environmental conditions in order to emulate the dynamic behaviour of savannas. Without such developments, however, TBMs will have limited predictive capability in making the critical projections needed to understand how savannas will respond to future global change.},

abstract = {Abstract. Bioclimatic indices for use in studies of ecosystem function, species distribution, and vegetation dynamics under changing climate scenarios depend on estimates of surface fluxes and other quantities, such as radiation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture, for which direct observations are sparse. These quantities can be derived indirectly from meteorological variables, such as near-surface air temperature, precipitation and cloudiness. Here we present a consolidated set of simple process-led algorithms for simulating habitats (SPLASH) allowing robust approximations of key quantities at ecologically relevant timescales. We specify equations, derivations, simplifications, and assumptions for the estimation of daily and monthly quantities of top-of-the-atmosphere solar radiation, net surface radiation, photosynthetic photon flux density, evapotranspiration (potential, equilibrium, and actual), condensation, soil moisture, and runoff, based on analysis of their relationship to fundamental climatic drivers. The climatic drivers include a minimum of three meteorological inputs: precipitation, air temperature, and fraction of bright sunshine hours. Indices, such as the moisture index, the climatic water deficit, and the Priestley–Taylor coefficient, are also defined. The SPLASH code is transcribed in C++, FORTRAN, Python, and R. A total of 1 year of results are presented at the local and global scales to exemplify the spatiotemporal patterns of daily and monthly model outputs along with comparisons to other model results.},

abstract = {Sustainable long-term storage of municipal waste and waste rock from mining activities in waste dumps (either above or below the land surface) requires minimization of percolation of rainwater into and then through stored waste material. There has been increasing attention given to the use of store-release covers (transpirational covers) to achieve this. However, the design of such covers remains problematic because of the unique combinations of weather, vegetation composition, soils and their interactions that determine the efficacy of each design that could be available for the construction of the covers. The aim of the work described here was to use ecophysiological knowledge of soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) interactions through the application of a detailed mechanistic model of the SPA continuum. We examined the relative influence of soil depth, soil texture, leaf area index and rainfall as determinants of rates of evapotranspiration and water budget for several different theoretical cover designs. We show that minimizing deep drainage requires a cover that has the following attributes: (i) a water storage capacity that is large enough to store the volume of water that is received as rainfall in above-average wet months/seasons; (ii) a root distribution that explores the entire depth of the cover; (iii) a leaf area index that is present all year sufficient to evapotranspire monthly rainfall; and (iv) takes into account the intra-annual and inter-annual variability in rainfall and other climatic variables that drive ET. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Groundwater-vegetation-atmosphere fluxes were monitored for a subtropical coastal conifer forest in South-East Queensland, Australia. Observations were used to quantify seasonal changes in transpiration rates with respect to temporal fluctuations of the local water table depth. The applicability of a Modified Jarvis-Stewart transpiration model (MJS), which requires soil-water content data, was assessed for this system. The influence of single depth values compared to use of vertically averaged soil-water content data on MJS-modelled transpiration was assessed over both a wet and a dry season, where the water table depth varied from the surface to a depth of 1.4 m below the surface. Data for tree transpiration rates relative to water table depth showed that trees transpire when the water table was above a threshold depth of 0.8 m below the ground surface (water availability is non-limiting). When the water table reached the ground surface (i.e., surface flooding) transpiration was found to be limited. When the water table is below this threshold depth, a linear relationship between water table depth and the transpiration rate was observed. MJS modelling results show that the influence of different choices for soil-water content on transpiration predictions was insignificant in the wet season. However, during the dry season, inclusion of deeper soil-water content data improved the model performance (except for days after isolated rainfall events, here a shallower soil-water representation was better). This study demonstrated that, to improve MJS simulation results, appropriate selection of soil water measurement depths based on the dynamic behaviour of soil water profiles through the root zone was required in a shallow unconfined aquifer system.},

abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the most important variables required for modelling growth and water use of forests. Functional{\^{a}}€“structural plant models use these models to represent physiological processes in 3-D tree representations. Accuracy of these models depends on accurate estimation of LAI at tree and stand scales for validation purposes. A recent method to estimate LAI from digital images (LAID) uses digital image capture and gap fraction analysis (Macfarlane et al. 2007b) of upward-looking digital photographs to capture canopy LAID (cover photography). After implementing this technique in Australian evergreen Eucalyptus woodland, we have improved the method of image analysis and replaced the time consuming manual technique with an automated procedure using a script written in MATLAB 7.4 (LAIM). Furthermore, we used this method to compare MODIS LAI values with LAID values for a range of woodlands in Australia to obtain LAI at the forest scale. Results showed that the MATLAB script developed was able to successfully automate gap analysis to obtain LAIM. Good relationships were achieved when comparing averaged LAID and LAIM (LAIM{\^{A}} ={\^{A}} 1.009 {\^{a}}€“ 0.0066 LAID; R2{\^{A}} ={\^{A}} 0.90) and at the forest scale, MODIS LAI compared well with LAID (MODIS LAI{\^{A}} ={\^{A}} 0.9591 LAID {\^{a}}€“ 0.2371; R2{\^{A}} ={\^{A}} 0.89). This comparison improved when correcting LAID with the clumping index to obtain effective LAI (MODIS LAI{\^{A}} ={\^{A}} 1.0296 LAIe{\^{A}} +{\^{A}} 0.3468; R2{\^{A}} ={\^{A}} 0.91). Furthermore, the script developed incorporates a function to connect directly a digital camera, or high resolution webcam, from a laptop to obtain cover photographs and LAI analysis in real time. The later is a novel feature which is not available on commercial LAI analysis softwares for cover photography. This script is available for interested researchers.},

@article{Whitley2015,
abstract = {Savanna ecosystems are one of the most dominant and complex terrestrial biomes that derives from a distinct vegetative surface comprised of co-dominant tree and grass populations. While these two vegetation types co-exist functionally, demographically they are not static, but are dynamically changing in response to environmental forces such as annual fire events and rainfall variability. Modelling savanna environments with the current generation of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) has presented many problems, particularly describing fire frequency and intensity, phenology, leaf biochemistry of C3 and C4 photosynthesis vegetation, and root water uptake. In order to better understand why TBMs perform so poorly in savannas, we conducted a model inter-comparison of 6 TBMs and assessed their performance at simulating latent energy (LE) and gross primary productivity (GPP) for five savanna sites along a rainfall gradient in northern Australia. Performance in predicting LE and GPP was measured using an empirical benchmarking system, which ranks models by their ability to utilise meteorological driving information to predict the fluxes. On average, the TBMs performed as well as a multi-linear regression of the fluxes against solar radiation, temperature and vapour pressure deficit, but were outperformed by a more complicated nonlinear response model that also included the leaf area index (LAI). This identified that the TBMs are not fully utilising their input information effectively in determining savanna LE and GPP, and highlights that savanna dynamics cannot be calibrated into models and that there are problems in underlying model processes. We identified key weaknesses in a model's ability to simulate savanna fluxes and their seasonal variation, related to the representation of vegetation by the models and root water uptake. We underline these weaknesses in terms of three critical areas for development. First, prescribed tree-rooting depths must be deep enough, enabling the extraction of deep soil water stores to maintain photosynthesis and transpiration during the dry season. Second, models must treat grasses as a co-dominant interface for water and carbon exchange, rather than a secondary one to trees. Third, models need a dynamic representation of LAI that encompasses the dynamic phenology of savanna vegetation and its response to rainfall interannual variability. We believe this study is the first to assess how well TBMs simulate savanna ecosystems, and that these results will be used to improve the representation of savannas ecosystems in future global climate model studies.},
